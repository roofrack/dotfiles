Vim Vixen can be configured to follow links opened in tabs in the background instead of switching to a new tab immediately. To do this, you'll need to update the config file: change the "background" property of the "follow.start" action to true, e.g.:

{
    "keymaps": {
        "F": { "type": "follow.start", "newTab": true, "background": true }
    }
}
