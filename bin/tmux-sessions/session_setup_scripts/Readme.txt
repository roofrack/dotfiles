This directory contains... 

1. Readme.txt
2. The tmux start a new session script (tmsetUpNewSession.sh)
3. The tmux template script for molding a new tmux session (tmux_template.sh)

How this dealio works is just run tmsetUpNewSession and thats it. You will get taken to 
a config file to add/delete different options for your new tmux session. Can edit this
new session file and tweak it however it suits you.
